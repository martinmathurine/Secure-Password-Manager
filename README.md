# Secure-Password-Manager
<h2>Application Security Through Hashing Technologies Developed with Java</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

A secure password manager application developed with Java to safely store, modify and remove an end-userâ€™s data and personal information. The application incorporates an authentication mechanism by leveraging hash maps for application security. This application will efficiently store and manage sensitive data, ensuring only the authenticated user has access. The use of hash maps for pairing unique keys to corresponding values streamlines the retrieval of user credentials and bolsters the application's defence against unauthorised access.

The main components of the application's design include a login system that safeguards the master user method as well as encryption mechanisms employed to obfuscate passwords. I implemented conditional statements, only permitting system modifications upon verification of proper credentials. This application illustrates my competency in the nuances of hashing algorithms and BigInteger's role in handling numerical values, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of what it takes to protect user data with precision and care.
